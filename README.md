Abstract: *Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.*

Clone the repository and its submodules:

``` sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/goldoak/GSFusion
# If you cloned the repository without the --recursive option, run the following command:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Set up LibTorch:

```sh
cd GSFusion
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu118/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1%2Bcu118.zip  
unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1+cu118.zip -d third_party/
rm libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.1+cu118.zip
```

Set up Open3D:
```sh
cd GSFusion
wget https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/releases/download/v0.18.0/open3d-devel-linux-x86_64-cxx11-abi-cuda-0.18.0.tar.xz

Build in release mode:

``` sh
cd GSFusion
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -- -j
```


## Download Datasets

### Replica

```
wget https://cvg-data.inf.ethz.ch/nice-slam/data/Replica.zip
unzip Replica.zip
```
The expected file structure is as follows:
```sh
<replica_scene_path>
├── results
│   ├── depthxxxxxx.png
│   ├── ...
│   ├── framexxxxxx.jpg
│   └── ...
└── traj.txt
```

### ScanNet++

Please follow the instructions on [ScanNet++](https://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannetpp/) website to download dataset and use the provided [toolbox](https://github.com/scannetpp/scannetpp/tree/main) to undistort and downscale the DSLR images. We downscale the images by a factor of 2 to prevent memory overflow. The expected file structure is as follows:
```sh
<scannetpp_scene_path>
├── nerfstudio
│   └── transforms_undistorted_2.json
├── undistorted_depths_2
│   ├── DSCxxxxx.png
│   └── ...
├── undistorted_images_2
│   ├── DSCxxxxx.JPG
│   └── ...
└── train_test_lists.json
```

**Note**: If you change the naming or structure of the dataset, ensure to also update the corresponding code in `app/include/reader_<dataset_name>.hpp`, `app/src/reader_<dataset_name>.cpp`, and `app/src/main.cpp` (line 98-101).


## Usage Example

Adjust the following fields in the YAML file under `config` folder to adapt to a specific scene in the Replica/ScanNet++ dataset:
```sh
# change the map dimension and resolution according to your needs
map:
  dim:                        [15, 15, 15]
  res:                        0.01

# replace the intrinsics if you use other scenes
sensor:
  width:                      1200
  height:                     680
  fx:                         600.0
  fy:                         600.0
  cx:                         599.5
  cy:                         339.5

reader:
  reader_type:                "replica"  # or "scannetpp"
  sequence_path:              "<replica_scene_path>"  # absolute path
  ground_truth_file:          "<replica_scene_path>/traj.txt"

app:
  optim_params_path:          "<project_root_path>/parameter/optimization_params_replica.json"  # absolute path
  ply_path:                   "<checkpoint_path>/point_cloud"  # absolute path
  mesh_path:                  "<checkpoint_path>/mesh"
```

You can also adjust the hyper-parameters for optimization in the JSON file under `parameter` folder. The provided JSON files are the ones we used for the results reported in the paper. Please refer to our paper for the meaning of those hyper-parameters.

**Note**: We highly recommend adjusting the above parameters when mapping new scenes to achieve better performance.

Now run the executable using the following commands:
```sh
cd GSFusion
# ScanNet++ dataset
./build/app/gsfusion config/scannetpp_8b5caf3398.yaml
# Replica dataset
./build/app/gsfusion config/replica_room0.yaml
```
